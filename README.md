During my recent portfolio project, I used the Bootstrap framework to design web pages, a new skill for me. As someone accustomed to mainly using HTML and CSS, working with Bootstrap was a shift. I learned to navigate Bootstrap's components and grid system, adapting my mindset for responsive designs. I faced challenges aligning my CSS knowledge with Bootstrap's classes, but by studying their interactions, I customized layouts effectively. This experience taught me to embrace new tech for creativity and adaptability in web development.
